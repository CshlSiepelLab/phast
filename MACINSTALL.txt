Here are some tips for getting PHAST to work on the Mac (OS X).

1. Editing make-include.mk

   As for any platform, edit the PHAST and CLAPACKPATH
   variables as appropriate

   Comment out the default CFLAGS line and uncomment the one marked
   for Mac OS X 

   Comment out LFLAGS = -static
    
   Edit the ARCH line: ARCH=MACOSX

2. Installing CLAPACK

    Download clapack.tgz from http://www.netlib.org/clapack, unpack in
    your directory of choice with 'tar xvfz clapack.tgz', and cd to
    the CLAPACK directory  

    Edit make.inc as follows:
        PLAT = _MACOSX
        CFLAGS = -funroll-all-loops -O3
        LOADOPTS = $(CFLAGS)
        NOOPT = $(CFLAGS)

    Follow the quick-start instructions in README.install: type make
    f2clib, then make blaslib, then make

3. Compiling PHAST

    cd to the src directory in your phast installation and type make
