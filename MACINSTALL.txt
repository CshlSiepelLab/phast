Here are some tips for getting PHAST to work on the Mac (OS X).

1. Editing make-include.mk

   As for any platform, edit the PHAST, GSLPATH, and CLAPACKPATH
   variables as appropriate

   Comment out the default CFLAGS line and uncomment the one marked
   for Mac OS X 

   Comment out LFLAGS = -static
    
   Edit the ARCH line: ARCH=MACOSX

2. Installing CLAPACK

    Download clapack.tgz from http://www.netlib.org/clapack, unpack in
    your directory of choice with 'tar xvfz clapack.tgz', and cd to
    the CLAPACK directory  

    Edit make.inc as follows:
        PLAT = _MACOSX
        CFLAGS = -funroll-all-loops -O3
        LOADOPTS = $(CFLAGS)
        NOOPT = $(CFLAGS)

    Follow the quick-start instructions in README.install: type make
    f2clib, then make blaslib, then make

3. Installing GSL

    Download gsl-1.x (whichever version is latest) from
    http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl, unpack in a temporary directory
    with 'tar xvfz gsl-1.x.tar.gz', and cd to gsl-1.x.

    Type ./configure --disable-shared CFLAGS=-Wno-long-double
    If you want the software to be installed in a location other than
    /usr/local, also add --prefix=<path>, where <path> is the root
    directory of the target installation

    Type make then make install.  You may also want to run make check
    (see the INSTALL file).

4. Compiling PHAST

    cd to the src directory in your phast installation and type make
