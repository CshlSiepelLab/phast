\description{
  Creates a new MSA (multiple sequence alignment) object.
}
\usage{
msa.new(nseqs = 0, seqlen = 0, names = NULL, seqs = NULL, alphabet = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{nseqs}{
    the number of sequences (ie, samples or rows) in the alignment.
}
\item{seqlen}{
  the length of the alignment (usually the number of base pairs).
}
  \item{names}{
    a character vector of length nseqs with the name of each sample,
    in the same order as given in the alignment.

}
  \item{seqs}{
    a character vector of length nseqs, each string of length seqlen,
    containing the alignment.
}
  \item{alphabet}{
    a character string containing all valid symbols that may appear
  in the alignment.
}
}
\details{
  If seqs is not NULL, nseqs and seqlen will be inferred from seqs, and
  a warning will be given if they do not match the arguments provided.
  The alphabet will not be inferred from seqs unless it is required in a
  downstream operation.
}

\section{Warning }{ Unlike most R objects, msa objects do not "copy by
  value".  Due to the potentially large size of alignments, the
  alignment is not copied unless msa.copy() is called explicitly.  An
  assignment msa2 <- msa1 will result in both MSA objects pointing to
  the same alignment in memory.}
