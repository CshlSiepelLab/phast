.SH "DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
Simple array-based lists and supporting functions.
.PP
  Elements stored in contiguous memory locations (for efficient caching performance). Supports storage of objects of arbitrary size. Convenience functions are available for common data types such as ints, doubles, and pointers. The 'stacks' and 'queues' libraries are layered on top of this one. Use these lists when memory locality is important or when you need to access elements by index; use linked-lists instead when (mid-list) insertions and deletions are important.
